# Multi-function activated WASD for time-series Neural Network
Implementation of a 3-layer feed-forward neural network (NN) model for time-series modeling and forecasting problems that is trained using a multi-function activated WASD (weights-and-structure-determination) for time-series algorithm, called MAWTS.
The purpose of this package is to solve time-series modeling and forecasting problems. The MAWTS algorithm employs four activation functions (AFs) to determine the MAWTSNNâ€™s optimal weights and structure, while employing cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
The main article used is the following:
*	S.D.Mourtas, V.N.Katsikis, "Continuous-Time Black-Litterman Portfolio Optimization: A Neural Network Approach", (submitted)

Also, the package includes the following two datasets:
*	Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US), Industrial Production: Utilities: Electric and Gas Utilities (NAICS = 2211,2) [IPG2211A2N], retrieved from FRED at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IPG2211A2N
*	Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US), Industrial Production: Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction: Gold Ore and Silver Ore Mining (NAICS = 21222) [IPG21222S], retrieved from FRED at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IPG21222S

# Installation
*	Unzip the file you just downloaded and copy the MAWTSNN directory to a location,e.g.,/my-directory/
*	Run Matlab/ Octave, Go to /my-directory/MAWTSNN/ at the command prompt
*	run 'Main_MAWTSNN (Matlab/Octave)

# Results
After running the 'Main_MAWTSNN.m file, the package outputs are the following:
*	The optimal number of hidden-layer neurons and the optimal input variables number.
